We want you to feel confident using our services, and this privacy policy ("Policy") is to help you understand and describe how we collect, use, and disclose information that we obtain about users of our websites, services, plug-ins, or software (all of which we refer to as the "Platform"). This Policy describes the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What information we collect and how it is collected;</li>
        <li>How we use the information;</li>
        <li>With whom we may share the information;</li>
        <li>Legal basis for processing the information;</li>
        <li>Your rights and choices;</li>
        <li>Security and storage of the information;</li>
        <li>Third party websites;</li>

        <li>California Disclosures; and</li>
        <li>Changes to the Policy and Contact Information.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We collect information about you directly from you and automatically through your use of our Platform. We may combine information automatically collected with other information that we have collected about you including from publicly available sources.</p>
      <p>In order to help you protect yourself and your information, we encourage you to provide only that information that is necessary for using our Platform. For example, to schedule a meeting you may only need to provide us with a name, email address, date and time.</p>

            <strong>Appointment Information.</strong>
            When an Appts User comes to Appts to schedule an event with an Appts Service Provider, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, email address and phone number; email addresses of other people; subject of the meeting; and any other information you provide us or as required by the Appts Service Provider you are scheduling with. If you receive an invitation from a Appts Service Provider but do not wish to become an Appts User, please contact the Calendly Member who sent the invitation through other means to set up your meeting.
          </p>
          <p>Appts Service Providers may also connect their calendar with Appts. Our calendar integration only adds events to your calendar or modifies ones it has previously added.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Account Information.</strong>

The information we get from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.
