      <h3>
        DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
      </h3>
      <b>Please Read This Provision Carefully. It Affects Your Legal Rights.</b>
      <p>
        This provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below) that may arise between you and us. Effectively, then, “dispute” is given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.
      </p>
      <p>
        This provision provides that all disputes between you and us will be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigation claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. We prefer this because we believe arbitration is less drama-filled than litigation. To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees). YOU AND APPTS ONLINE AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.
      </p>
      <u>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</u>
      <p>
        For all disputes, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve the dispute which is first done by e-mailing us at admin@appts.online the following information: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If we do not resolve the dispute within 45 days after receiving your notification, then you may pursue your dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.
      </p>
      <u>Arbitration Procedures</u>
      <p>
        If this provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or we may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be commenced as an individual arbitration, and will in no event be commenced as a class arbitration. This provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration. Because this Website and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit. You or we may initiate arbitration in either Georgia or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address. In the event that you select the latter, we may transfer the arbitration to Georgia so long as we agree to pay any additional fees or costs which the arbitrator determines you incur as a result of the transfer. So long as you place a request in writing prior to commencement of the arbitration, we will pay all arbitration fees and associated costs and expenses. But, you will still be responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration which include but are not limited to attorneys’ fees or expert witnesses.
      </p>
      <u>Class Action Waiver</u>
      <p>
        Except as otherwise provided in this provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and Appts Online specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration. If you choose to pursue your dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other user of this Website can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.
      </p>
      <u>Other</u>
      <p>
        You understand and agree that by accepting this provision in these Terms, you and we are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. If any clause within this provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this provision whose remainder will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court. This provision will survive the termination of your account with us or our affiliates and your discontinued use of this Website. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if we make any change to this provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require us to adhere to the language in this provision if a dispute between us arises.
      </p>

        GENERAL TERMS
      </h3>
      <p>
        We think direct communication resolves most issues – if we feel that you are not complying with these Terms, we will likely tell you. We may even provide you with recommended necessary corrective action(s) if possible. However, certain violations of these Terms, as determined by us, may require immediate termination of your access to this Website without prior notice to you. The Federal Arbitration Act, Georgia state law and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Except for disputes subject to arbitration as described above, any disputes relating to these Terms or this Website will be heard in the courts located in Phoenix, Arizona. Except as otherwise set forth in the dispute resolution provision, if any of these Terms are deemed inconsistent with applicable law, then such term(s) will be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified. By choosing not to enforce any of these Terms, we are not waiving our rights. These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and the Data Processing Addendum (as applicable), contain the entire agreement between you and us and, therefore, supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements between Appts Online and you about the Website and our services. The rights of Appts Online under our Terms will survive the termination of our Terms.
